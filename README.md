To build this source, you will need Easy68K/EasyBIN. The binaries produced by EasyBIN can be played directly via emulator. Sound is not yet implemented. A pre-assembled binary can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/JIoffe/DragonRabbit/releases).

*Note: This is my first attempt at writing a game for the Genesis using M68K assembly. I am learning as I go and the code may not be following best practices. This project is for educational purposes only.*

## Premise
With the soul of a dragon and katana in hand, this rabbit sets out to eradicate supernatural evil from this world.
2-D Side-Scrolling Platformer concept. There is a single platforming level so far and a bonus stage at the end.
