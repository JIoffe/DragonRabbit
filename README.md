Pre-assembled binaries can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/JIoffe/DragonRabbit/releases).

To build this source, you will need [EASy68K/EASyBIN](http://easy68k.com/) for the 68K code and [WinAPE](http://www.winape.net/) for Z80 code.
The mnemonics used may or may not be compatible with other assemblers.

*Note: This is my first attempt at writing a game for the Genesis using M68K assembly. I am learning as I go and the code may not be following best practices. This project is for educational purposes only.*
